					<h2>Winter Olympic Game</h2>
					<p>The first organized international competition involving winter sports was introduced just five years after the birth of the modern Olympics in 1896. Known as the Nordic Games, this competition included athletes predominantly from Nordic countries (such as Norway and Sweden).</p>
					<p>Few years later an agreement was reached to celebrate an IOC-sanctioned International Winter Sports Week. Held in Chamonix, France, in 1924, the event was a huge success.</p>

					<h3>Winter Olympic Games all-time medal table Top 5 countries from 1896 to 2014</h3>


					<ul>
						<li>As you can see from these two bar charts, it is visually shown how well Canada performed in the past 22 Winter Olympic Games from 1896-2014.</li>
						<li>By total medals, Canada into second place by 625 total which is only 28 medals behind the Top1 Country - USA.</li>

				<h2>CANADA's each Winter Olympic Games performance</h2>

				<div class="argu2text">

					<ul>
						<li>Canada (IOC country code CAN) has competed at every Winter Olympic Games, and has won at least one medal each time. By total medals, the country's best performance was in the 2014 Winter Olympic Games where Canadian athletes won 90 medals in total.</li>
						<li>From the line chart, there are three clear trends in the past 22 Olympic games. First, a smooth and steady trend from 1924-1968, there is a slight float but overall is in the initial development stage. </li>
						<li>The second period is 1972-1988. Look at that trend and the medal during that period are very, very low. Magnussen’s medal was Canada’s only podium result of the Games, making the Sapporo Games the Canada's poorest medal showing at a Winter Olympics since 1924.</li>
					</ul>
						<h3>Have you ever thought about why Canada did not perform well between 1972-1988 and how to lose the home-court advantage in 1988 in Calgary?</h3>
						<p>I did a lot of reserach but there is no useful information can excatlly explain why Canada did not perform well between 1972-1988. 
						The only information I got is Canada was not a winter sport power in 1988.[Wikipedia,2020c]</p>

						<p class="argu3p1">Can you imagine that how welL Canada done in 2010 and 2014 these two years?</p>
						<p class="argu3p2">At the 2010 Winter Olympics, which was hosted in Vancouver, British Columbia. Canada won more gold medals than any other competing nation for the first time and more than quintupled the five medals it won in Calgary at the 2010 Winter Olympics also.</p>
						<p class="argu3p3">Canada set a new record for most gold medals won by a country in a single Winter Olympics with 14 at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, Canada. This achievement surpassed the previous record of 13 gold medals held by the Soviet Union (1976) and Norway (2002).</p>

					<ul>
						<li>One of the important Olympic sports sprits is dismantling barriers, building bridges, and bringing people together regardless of race, nationality, or gender.</li>
						<li>Under the leadership of IOC(THE INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE), there are more and more women athletes join the game.</li>
						<li>As you can from the pie chart. For Canada, women athletes won the first winter Olympic medal in 1948. That is only 5 percent of the total medal for that year.</li>
						<li>However, as time goes on, Canada encourages and trains more and more female athletes to join the competition. In 1998, women's proportion of medals was highly up to 66.67%, and it's double mens! </li>
						<li>In 2006 and 2010, even though the women's contribution is slightly down to around 50%, the number of medals is increasing year by year.  This data shows that female competitors, competition events and women's strength are developed year by year.</li>
